BASIC programs I wrote back in high school. Here is a breakdown of a few of them:

PTANK2-1: The most recent version of a program that was made as a BASIC version of a Blitwise 
game called Pocket Tanks. I had the game and decided to see if I could write it in BASIC during my 
programming class my freshman year. This is as far as I got before the end of the semester. The progress can be seen from all the versions of this program.\

SKETCH: A simple etch-a-sketch program that simply draws a line with the arrow keys.

PONG: Well the name says it, this is a Pong game.

MATRIX: Simply scrolls random strings of letters and numbers in green that vaguely resembles the Matrix.

GRAPH: A program that creates a graph of an input function.

ANGLE: I used this program as a basis for the PTANKS game. It creates a line that follows the circumference of the circle from its origin, i.e. just a radius that rotates. }
